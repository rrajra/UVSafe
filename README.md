# UVSafe â˜€

A WIP electron app which uses API calls to determine whether or not you should wear sunscreen that day.

UVSafe currently uses 2 APIs.

[OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/) allows users to enter where they live, and it will provide a latitude / longitude pair.

[OpenUV](https://www.openuv.io/) takes that latitude / longitude pair and then returns UV data about that location.
